# NREGA-POWER-BI-DASHBOARD<br>
This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
(NREGA), a transformative government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed
wage employment opportunities. The dataset used for this analysis encompasses a wide range of
parameters, including the number of job cards issued, the workforce engaged, budget allocation, work
completion statistics, and much more. Through the application of data analytics techniques, we aim to
gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts
in India.<br>
This project aims to analyze and visualize the NREGA dataset to extract meaningful insights.<br>
The scope includes:<br>
● Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality.<br>
● Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and disparities in
NREGA implementation.<br>
● Utilizing data visualization techniques to present key findings effectively.<br>
● Drawing actionable insights to inform policymakers and administrators about the strengths
and weaknesses of the NREGA program.<br>
